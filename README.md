I followed lab-9, lab-10, and lab-11 as a model.

to create and lay-out basic components such as forms and tables, i followed mainly lab-9.

about database, api, routs, very much i followed between lab-10 and 11.

in WeightTracker.vue that a line of code in line 7 "@submit.prevent="addRecord"this line of code suggested by TJ to help the 
table to holde still the objects.

TJ and I worked as a stedy group for 3 times. I solenly work on my project.
